label: Evidence Container
specification: |
  A container for information extracted from a source. Uses identifiers
  to describe subjects without making conclusions about specific persons.
  Evidence can float unattached or be associated with multiple persons
  with different confidence levels.
  
  Key characteristics:
  - Immutable after creation (represents what source actually says)
  - Can exist independently (floating evidence)
  - Can be claimed by multiple persons with different confidence
  - Must cite at least one source
  
  This addresses the fundamental "Which John Smith?" problem where
  evidence mentions someone but you don't yet know which person in
  your database they are.
