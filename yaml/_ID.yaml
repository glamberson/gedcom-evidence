label: Identifier
specification: |
  Text from a source that identifies the subject of evidence.
  Multiple identifiers provide context for identity resolution.
  
  Common identifier types:
  - Names: "John Smith", "Mary Jones"
  - Relationships: "son of William", "wife of Robert"
  - Ages: "aged 40", "75 years old"
  - Occupations: "blacksmith", "farmer"
  - Descriptions: "the elder", "Jr.", "of Hamilton County"
  - Dates: "born 1810", "died last Tuesday"
  
  Identifiers should be extracted as close to the original
  source text as practical. They help researchers determine
  which person in their database the evidence refers to.
